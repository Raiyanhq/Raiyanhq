## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Raiyan!

A Computer Science major with a minor in Finance at Georgia State University, passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Full Stack Development. Iâ€™ve worked on various AI projects, including building AI-powered applications and developing real-time data transmission systems. I have experience across both front-end and back-end technologies, with a focus on Python, ReactJS, Node.js, and Swift for iOS app development.

Currently, Iâ€™m an undergraduate research assistant, where I develop solutions that enhance data accessibility and drive operational efficiency. In my spare time, I enjoy participating in hackathons and contributing to open-source projects, aiming to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
